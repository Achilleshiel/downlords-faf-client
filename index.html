      <h1>Downlord's Forged Alliance Forever Client</h1>

      <p>Do you also feel that the current FAF client is out-of-date? Would you love to see a modern,
        <strong>actively</strong> developed and <strong>future-proof</strong> client? So am I. That's why I started
        this re-implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        While <strong>I'm doing this for free</strong>, donations help me investing more time into this project. It
        really makes a difference! As a little thank-you, I'll provide the following "rewards":
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>$5 or more</strong> I'll send you a PM to thank you for your support</li>
        <li><strong>$10 or more</strong> I'll play a game with you</li>
        <li><strong>$25 or more</strong> Your name will be listed in the "backers" list within the client</li>
        <li><strong>$50 or more</strong> Your name will go into the "special thanks" section in the client's "About"
          window. I will work closely with you (Skype, Teamspeak, Mumble, etc.) and ask you for feedback, if desired.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The client needs to implement all important features of the current client.</p>

        game-lobby while having a smoke. To mention just some of the possibilities.

      <h1>Questions you may ask</h1>

      <h2><a name="who-are-you">Who are you anyway?</a></h2>

      <p>My name is Michel (aka Downlord), I'm 27 and I've been a professional software engineer since 2008 (well, that
        time I was rather crappy). Recently I was part of a 100-man development team that has been developing the
        <a href="http://www.six-interbank-clearing.com/en/home/payment-services/sic/sic4-new-sic-architecture.html">
          Swiss RTGS system SIC</a> which is a two-digit million dollar project basically handling the Swiss bank's
        money. Since its launch date on 16.
        April it had no single failure - so trust me when I tell you: I know what high quality software looks like
        (swiss made, anyone? ;-)).</p>

      <p>I quit this exciting project in September 2014 since I wanted to change something in my life; I wanted to be
        self-employed. And here I am now.</p>

      <h2><a name="why-a-new-client">Why a new client?</a></h2>

      <p>While the current client fulfills its purpose, it's pretty crippled. There are many bugs, it doesn't look
        really
        good and, from a technical perspective, the design is flawed.</p>

      <p>So why not just fixing the old client? Well, fixing code instead of replacing it is more efficient up to a
        certain point. But once that point is crossed and there is too much to fix (not only bugs, but a flawed design),
        you're better off rewriting it from scratch. Has that point been crossed? Well, I'm not that sure, but as far as
        I can tell it's surely pretty close to it. <strong>And looking at how the server updates went so far, I seemed
          to be pretty much right.</strong></p>

      <p>But here is the main problem: we don't have the resources. While there pop up people here and there wanting to
        help, what is needed is at least one committed and skilled developer. Sheeo you say? Well, he's so busy fixing
        the server code (which is much worse than the client code) that he probably won't have time in the near future.
      </p>

      <p>So why don't I fix it you ask? Because I'm neither a skilled Python developer nor do I have the desire to
        become one. I am however, an experienced and skilled Java developer (unfortunately there's no trueskill for
        developers to prove that claim :-))</p>

      <h2><a name="will-this-split">Will this split the community?</a></h2>

      <p>No, the client completely integrates within the existing system. People using the old client can always
        interact
        with people using the new client; they won't even notice there's a difference (except that one swears about the
        client bugs and the other finds it super smooth :-)).</p>
