      <h1>Downlord's Forged Alliance Forever Client</h1>

      <p>Do you also feel that the current FAF client is out-of-date? Would you love to see a modern,
        <strong>actively</strong> developed and <strong>future-proof</strong> client? So am I. That's why I started
        this re-implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        While <strong>I'm doing this for free</strong>, donations help me investing more time into this project. It
        really makes a difference! As a little thank-you, I'll provide the following "rewards":
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>$5 or more</strong> Thank you very much!</li>
        <li><strong>$10 or more</strong> I'll send you a PM to thank you for your support</li>
        <li><strong>$25 or more</strong> Your name will be listed in the "backers" list within the client</li>
        <li><strong>$50 or more</strong> Your name will go into the "special thanks" section in the client's "About"
          window. I will work closely with you (Skype, Teamspeak, Mumble, etc.) and ask you for feedback, if desired.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Basic features</h2>

      First of all, I have to reimplement all important features of the current lobby.

      <h2>Mobile app</h2>

      <p>I'd like to create a mobile app (iOS and Android) that connects to your FAF client (through WLAN) allowing you
        to continue chatting while sitting on the toilet (please, just don't tell us about it) and observing the
        game-lobby while having a smoke. To mention just some of the possibilities. This will be free for donators and
        $1.- for others.

      <h1>Questions you may ask</h1>

      <h2><a name="who-are-you">Who are you anyway?</a></h2>

      <p>My name is Michel (aka Downlord), I'm 26 and I've been a professional software engineer since 2008 (well, that
        time I was rather crappy). Recently I was part of a 100-man development team that has been developing the
        <a href="http://www.six-interbank-clearing.com/en/home/payment-services/sic/sic4-new-sic-architecture.html">
          Swiss RTGS system SIC</a> which is a two-digit million dollar project basically handling the Swiss bank's
        money. Since its launch date on 16.
        April it had no single failure - so trust me when I tell you: I know what high quality software looks like
        (swiss made, anyone? ;-)).</p>

      <p>I quit this exciting project in September 2014 since I wanted to change something in my life; I wanted to be
        self-employed. And here I am now.</p>

      <h2><a name="why-a-new-lobby">Why a new lobby?</a></h2>

      <p>While the current lobby fulfills its purpose, it's pretty crippled. There are many bugs, it doesn't look really
        good and, from a technical perspective, the design is flawed.</p>

      <p>So why not just fixing the old lobby? Well, fixing code instead of replacing it is more efficient up to a
        certain point. But once that point is crossed and there is too much to fix (not only bugs, but a flawed design),
        you're better off rewriting it from scratch. Has that point been crossed? Well, I'm not that sure, but as far as
        I can tell it's surely pretty close to it.</p>

      <p>But here is the main problem: we don't have the resources. While there pop up people here and there wanting to
        help, what is needed is at least one committed and skilled developer. Sheeo you say? Well, he's so busy fixing
        the server code (which is much worse than the client code) that he probably won't have time in the near future.
      </p>

      <p>So why don't I fix it you ask? Because I'm neither a skilled Python developer nor do I have the desire to
        become one. I am however, an experienced and skilled Java developer (unfortunately there's no trueskill for
        developers to prove that claim :-))</p>

      <h2><a name="will-this-split">Will this split the community?</a></h2>

      <p>No, the lobby completely integrates within the existing system. People using the old lobby can always interact
        with people using the new lobby; they won't even notice there's a difference (except that one swears about the
        lobby bugs and the other finds it super smooth :-)).</p>

      <h2>What if the donation goals won't be reached?</h2>

      <p>Every $100.- allows me to work like 12h on this project (you see, I slave myself). That is, the more people
        donate, the more I can work on it. If people are no longer donating, I will <strong>reduce but not
          eliminate</strong> my time
        spent. So your money will always bring this project forward - and keep in mind, there's already an almost usable
        version before donations even started.</p>

      <h2><a name="can-i-test">Can I test it?</a></h2>

      <p>I'll provide a downloadable version soon, but I don't feel it's ready yet.</p>

      <h2><a name="why-should-i-donate">What are donations used for?</a></h2>

      <p>When I started re-implementing the FAF lobby in March 2015, it was just a fun project for myself, since I
        wanted something to learn JavaFX 8.0. Since then I spent a lot of my "free" time (self-employed, remember?)
        integrating more and more features because it's a lot of fun!</p>

      <p>However, all that time is unpaid but the bills keep coming. So I have to make a decision: drastically reducing
        the time working on it to have more time for things that actually pay, or trying to get you helping me out so
        that I can keep working on it all day long for weeks without having to worry about losing my flat. That way I'm
        able to progress pretty fast, providing you a clean, good documented and actively developed lobby for a bright
        FAF future.</p>

      <h2><a name="what-if">What if the current lobby is suddenly improved?</a></h2>

      <p>Maybe someone picks up on the current lobby (acutally
        <a href="http://forums.faforever.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=5633">PattogoTehen already did</a>) and my work
        seems obsolete, what then? First of all, as you can see in the linked topic, PattogoTehen added improvements to
        the lobby that didn't make their way into the official client <strong>for almost two years</strong>. But even if
        this suddenly changes and he becomes the new lobby councilor, I don't think he (or anyone else) will have enough
        time to <i>really</i> improve the lobby rather than just applying patches here and there. Because this would
        take
        <i>months</i> of work for someone doing it in their spare time. However, if an <strong>unexpected
          miracle</strong>
        happens that renders this project completely useless, I would stop working on it and refund any excess donations
        (e. g. if I worked for 1 month but received $3,000.- I would refund $2,000.-).</p>
